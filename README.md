Hi! Welcome to my first Hyper Island project: 90s themed website!
My 90s was full of Baskin Robbins Icecreams, so here it is.

Happy to have learned the fundamentals for HTML and CSS for the past 5 weeks, it was super fun. 
There were some frustrating moments but now I am quite confident with the layouts and making it responsive. 

Welcome to my page and thank you for your visit :)
